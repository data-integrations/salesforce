Feature: Salesforce Batch Source - Run time Scenarios


  @BATCH-TS-SF-RNTM-01 @BQ_SINK_TEST
  Scenario Outline: Verify user should be able to preview the pipeline where Salesforce is configured for valid SObject Name
    When Open Datafusion Project to configure pipeline
    And Select data pipeline type as: "Batch"
    And Select plugin: "Salesforce" from the plugins list as: "Source"
    And Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "Salesforce"
    And fill Authentication properties for Salesforce Admin user
    And configure Salesforce source for an SObject Query of SObject: "<SObjectName>"
    And fill Last modified After in format: yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ssZ: "lastmodified.after"
    Then Validate "Salesforce" plugin properties
    And Capture the generated Output Schema
    And Close the Plugin Properties Page
    And Select Sink plugin: "BigQueryTable" from the plugins list
    And Navigate to the properties page of plugin: "BigQuery"
    And Configure BigQuery sink plugin for Dataset and Table
    Then Validate "BigQuery" plugin properties
    And Close the Plugin Properties Page
    And Connect source as "Salesforce" and sink as "BigQueryTable" to establish connection
    And Save the pipeline
    And Preview and run the pipeline
    And Verify the preview of pipeline is "success"
    And Verify sink plugin's Preview Data for Input Records table and the Input Schema matches the Output Schema of Source plugin
    Examples:
      | SObjectName |
      | LEAD        |
